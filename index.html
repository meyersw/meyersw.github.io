            <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>With over 20 years of experience in both the private sector and academia, I have developed a diverse skill set that uniquely positions me to contribute effectively to any organization.</p>

<p>From 2004 to 2010, I served as a Project Manager at a major retail corporation. In this role, I was responsible for implementing design visions while exercising creativity and autonomy to achieve project goals. This experience allowed me to collaborate closely with leadership, encouraging innovation and continuous learning. I was given the freedom to explore new ideas and approaches, which fostered a sense of adventure and adaptability in my professional endeavors.</p>

<p>In addition to my project management experience, I have extensive experience in hiring and training staff. As a Customer Service and Sales Supervisor at a college bookstore, I managed recruitment, training, scheduling, evaluation, and payroll for a part-time workforce. This role honed my ability to balance budgetary constraints with staffing needs and navigate the challenges of recruiting reliable part-time employees.</p>

<p>I have over 10 years of experience as a mathematics instructor, during which I have taught a variety of courses including Algebra 1, Algebra 2, College Algebra, Professional Math, Discrete Math, Geometry, Applied Technical Mathematics and Computer Science Principles. I hold a DESE certification for secondary mathematics in the state of Missouri and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Education. My teaching experience has reinforced the importance of long-term planning and the positive impact it can have on student success. I am passionate about education and committed to helping students achieve their full potential.</p>

<p>My long-term involvement with the collegiate community, both as a student and an employee, has provided me with a deep understanding of various campus resources. My experience as a teacher has underscored the importance of long-term planning and the positive impact it can have on program success. I have always been committed to connecting individuals with the right resources to meet their needs.</p>

<p>I am confident that my combination of academic knowledge and practical experience positions me to make a meaningful contribution to any organization. I am excited about the opportunity to be part of a team that provides valuable services to its community, especially during times of growth and integration of support services.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering my experiences and qualifications. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.</p>
